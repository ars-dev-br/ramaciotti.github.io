André is a software developer based in Florianópolis, an island in southern Brazil.
He is the kind of person that enjoys writing about themselves in the third person, but he'll try to keep this short.

In Computer Science, he is really into programming languages and systems performance.
He also likes reading about distributed systems, though more as a curiosity than as an academic or professional subject.
His GitHub profile is [https://github.com/ramaciotti/](https://github.com/ramaciotti/).

André's hobbies include lifting heavy things and putting them back to place, playing the guitar, reading, and writing.
