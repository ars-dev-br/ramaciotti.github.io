      <p>
        I am a modern magician.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a <span class="joke" title="Software engineer">
          conjurer</span>, I create something out of
        nothing. I write mystic runes in powerful languages, and
        things start happening.

      </p>

      <p>
        Besides Conjuration, I dabble in <span class="joke"
        title="Cooking">Alchemy</span>, too. I mix ingredients, apply some
        heat, follow some rituals, and end up with a delicious
        concoction.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also enjoy reading (non-fiction, sci-fi, and fantasy, as you
        might have guessed), weightlifting (with my body, not
        telekinetically, mind you), and listening to Classical Music.
