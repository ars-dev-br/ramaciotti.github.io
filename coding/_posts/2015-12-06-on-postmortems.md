Developers often say it's all about picking the right tools for the right job.
That's true, but few people talk about the tools they've chosen and how they fared.
This way, we end up losing a good part of our experience as professionals.
Each developer has to relearn the same lessons about the same languages and libraries.

Postmortems are a good way for programmers to share these experiences.
They allow us to talk about what worked out and what didn't work so great.
As I enjoy learning new stuff and I'm working at a company that permits this kind of experimentation, I'll write more of them as I have the chance.

Postmortems are also hard to write, as they mix personal taste with technical arguments.
In my texts, I'll try to keep it clear when it's one or the other.
You can check them filled on the [postmortems tag](//www.ramaciotti.com/tags/#postmortems).
