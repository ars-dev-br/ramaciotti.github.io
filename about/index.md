Hey!

My name is André.
I live in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina -- southern Brazil --, and I'm currently employed at [Fundação CERTI](http://certi.org.br/)[^1].

[^1]: You know how it goes: this blog is about my own opinion and do not reflect the opinion of my past, present or future employer, yada yada yada.

I'm a programming languages geek.
Although I only have profissional experience with C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript, I love learning new languages.
Some of my favorites are Haskell and OCaml, and I hope to improve my skills in Clojure, Elixir, and Rust soon.

On this blog you will find random ramblings about software development in general, and maybe a little about me too.
However, I tend not to focus on a single topic.
You may find me writing about systems performance one day and about type systems the next day.

I believe programming should be more inviting for everyone, and the least I can do about it is trying to not be a jerk.
So if you feel I wrote something unappropriate, send me an email, and I'll edit the post and watch myself to not do that again.

In my spare time I like to play the guitar.
I listen mostly to heavy metal, but that's not the only genre I like.
I also enjoy black metal, death metal, doom metal, progressive metal, thrash metal...
Other stuff I find fun is weight training, investing (C.R.E.A.M., etc.), playing games (tabletop or not), and reading.
