Functional programming is hard.
Object-oriented programming isn't much better, but after some time we got accostumed to it.
If you are like me, you probably confused classes and objects a lot until eventually it became natural to know which is which.

Then came more complex concepts:
interfaces, inheritance, (non-)virtual methods, abstract methods, design patterns...

There's a big difference, though.
Texts about object-oriented concepts are more didactic.
Imagine how would it be like if when someone searched about the visitor pattern

> The Visitor pattern...

It's technically correct, but it doesn't help much.

This is what usually happens when someone asks what a monad is.
People say stuff like:

> Monads can be seen as monoids in the category of endo functors (...)

Or, even worse, they make silly analogies with monads and Mexican food or monads and pets.

Don't search for meaning in Haskell.
Search for it in your favorite religion or inside yourself.
Instead, use Haskell for making things.



### Functors

### Monads

Monads are basically laws that rule how a sort of syntatic sugar works.
I've previously written about it, but I guess I focused too much on the semicolons.
This other guy has made a better job at explaining the expansions and what is actually happening behind the covers.

### Monoids
